        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Beans on toast have been eaten for years everyday in the UK for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's a super simple dish, but it's comfort food on a plate for many of us. I hope you'll enjoy it, too!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tin 13.7 oz (390 g) of Heinz beans (made in England)</li>
            <li>3 slices of bread</li>
            <li>(pat of butter is optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the beans into a small pot over medium low heat.</li>
            <li>Put the bread in the toaster, and make the toast as desired. (If you like, you can butter the toast, but I find it unecessary as the beans are the primary flavor.)</li>
            <li>Stir the beans, and heat until almost boiling, but don't allow to boil. (According to directions on the tin, this will affect the flavor.)</li>
            <li>Place the toast on plates, and spoon â…“ tin of the beans over the top of each slice. Serve immediately, preferably with a cup of hot tea.</li>
        </ol>
